# This script sets up a question-answering system using LangChain, Hugging Face's Flan-T5-large model, and a custom vectorstore.
# It retrieves relevant context from the vectorstore based on a user's question and uses the LLM to generate a concise and informative answer.
# It also handles greetings and cases where no relevant information is found.
# running dirctly will allow you to test the service from the cmd
